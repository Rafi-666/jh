        <h1>Why reading self-help books in the first place!</h1>
        <p>
            According to one review of the scientific literature, self-help books
            are more effective at helping us learn new life skills, like
            assertiveness, problem-solving, and even tidiness. What is this? That's
            good news for everybody since we can all benefit from learning new
            skills that help us to navigate our lives.

            Ikigai: The Japanese secret to a long and happy life The people of Japan
            believe that everyone has an ikigai – a reason to jump out of bed each
            morning. And according to the residents of the Japanese island of
            Okinawa – the world’s longest-living people – finding it is the key to a
            longer and more fulfilled life. Inspiring and comforting, this book will
            give you the life-changing tools to uncover your personal ikigai. It
            will show you how to leave urgency behind, find your purpose, nurture

            In The Four Agreements, don Miguel Ruiz reveals the source of
            self-limiting beliefs that rob us of joy and create needless suffering.
            Based on ancient Toltec wisdom, the Four Agreements offer a powerful
            code of conduct that can rapidly transform our lives to a new experience
            of freedom, true happiness, and love. The Four Agreements are: Be
            Impeccable With Your Word, Don't Take Anything Personally, Don't Make
            Assumptions, Always Do Your Best.</p>

        <h1>3.The Art of Thinking Clearly</h1>
        <p>In engaging prose and with practical examples and anecdotes, an eye-opening look at human reasoning and
            essential reading for anyone with important decisions to make.

            Have you ever:
        <ul>
            <li> Invested time in something that, with hindsight, just wasn't worth it?</li>
            <li>Overpayed in an Ebay auction?</li>
            <li>Continued doing something you knew was bad for you?</li>
            <li>Sold stocks too late, or too early?</li>
            <li>Taken credit for success, but blamed failure on external circumstances?</li>
            <li>Backed the wrong horse?</li>
        </ul>

        These are examples of cognitive biases, simple errors we all make in our day-to-day thinking. But by knowing
        what they are and how to spot them, we can avoid them and make better choices-whether dealing with a personal
        problem or a business negotiation; trying to save money or make money; working out what we do or don't want in
        life: and how best to get it.</p>

        <h1>4.The Art of War</h1>
        <p>Twenty-Five Hundred years ago, Sun Tzu wrote this classic book of military strategy based on Chinese warfare
            and military thought. Since that time, all levels of military have used the teaching on Sun Tzu to warfare
            and civilization have adapted these teachings for use in politics, business and everyday life. The Art of
            War is a book which should be used to gain advantage of opponents in the boardroom and battlefield alike.

        <h1>5.Man's Search for Meaning</h1>
        <p>Humans in suffering tend to feel hopeless with a deep sense of failure. MAN's SEARCH FOR MEANING (Frankl,
            1984) is a helpful book during such times: it is highly probable that one would find a solution to their
            depressed feelings, if the book is read actively.

            Written by Austrian neurologist-psychiatrist and a Holocaust survivor Victor Frankl, this book is simple yet
            intense and reflective. Frankl is the founder of Logotherapy, a form of existential psychology. Awarded with
            several accolades, his books and talks are the most inspiring on finding meaning in life and in suffering.

            The book stands out extraordinarily as Frankl, by narrating his life instances in the Auschwitz
            concentration camp, presents the remarkable idea of how we can choose to see a purpose or meaning in any
            situation, including the worst conditions. He descriptively illustrates his personal experiences and
            observations of minute human changes which infuses hope into the reader.</p>
